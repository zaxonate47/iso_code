            	<h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>The annual cultural fest of the <strong>MSU Indian Students Organization</strong>, Sargam has grown from being a small event taking place within the confines of he MSU campus to a musical/histrionic extravaganza that the MSU community looks forward to year after year</p>
               <p>This year, Sargam takes the historical route, drawing inspiration from one of India's most ancient literary works, <em>Vethala Panchavimshanti (Sanskrit: The twenty five tales of the ghost).</em> Vikram-Vetal follows the journey of the titular King Vikram as he strives to capture a <em>Vetal (Sanskrit: Ghost).</em> in order to fulfill a promise he made to a hermit.</p>
               <p>The wily Vetal he eventually encounters isn't about to give in so easily and makes a strange proposition to the mighty King - The Vetal shall narrate a story and if the King utters even a single word, he has to sit through another story; as each story concludes, the King realises that reining in his ego is a mightier task than reining in a thousand ghosts!</p>
               <p>Sargam 2011 is an amalgamation of Indian culture, tradition and some good ol'fashioned humor. All are welcome!</p>
